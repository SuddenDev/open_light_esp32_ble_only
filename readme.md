# Open Light: SMART SMALL SPACE LIGHT.

ESP32 Side with BLE & Wifi compability. 

## What is this about?

**Do you live in a small space? We do.**
And often you're not allowed to drill holes into the wall or you don't want to put up with filling the holes afterwards. But what should you do, if the lighting situation is still not great and you're missing a welcoming light?
That's what this project is for. We aim to build a modular lamp, that fits right into your home. It's supposed to be customizable, open source and not too expensive.
